# Bamboo-Spec-POCs
Created this repo in order to capture experimenting with Bamboo Java specs.

In order to test the POCs, I created a VMware virtual machine installed with the Windows 10 OS,
and then installed the following additional tools:

1. JDK-8u221 for Windows (64-bit)
2. Atlassian Bamboo Server 6.10.3
3. Apache Maven for Windows 3.6.2
4. Git for Windwos 2.23.0 (64-bit)
5. Eclipse for Windows

More content will be added when needed.
